# Course Functionality Fix Summary

## 🎯 **Problem Solved**

The user reported that course creation and nested content (topics, files, videos, study resources) were not working properly in the semester management system. All functionality has been **completely fixed and tested**.

## 🔧 **Issues Identified & Fixed**

### 1. **Course Creation for Existing Semesters**
- **Problem**: The PUT endpoint for editing semesters only updated semester info, not courses
- **Solution**: Enhanced `/api/section-admin/semesters/[id]/route.ts` to handle course creation/updates during semester edits
- **Fix**: Added complete course processing with topics, slides, videos, and study resources

### 2. **Data Structure Mismatch**
- **Problem**: Frontend used `code` field while backend expected `course_code`
- **Solution**: Fixed data transformation in `enhanced-section-semester-management.tsx`
- **Fix**: Updated course mapping to use `course_code` consistently

### 3. **Missing Teacher Information**
- **Problem**: Teacher name and email weren't being properly handled in edit mode
- **Solution**: Added `teacher_name` and `teacher_email` to course data transformation
- **Fix**: Ensured all required course fields are properly mapped

## ✅ **What's Now Working**
